#  ABM toy model of innovation diffusion
The presented Agent based model (short: ABM) of innovation diffusion is a very basic ABM that can model the temporal and spatial parts of an Innovation diffusion process. The focus in this repository is lied on the main feature, which are the gradients of the model. These gradients make a faster and more efficient calibration possible. 

The model is part of the publication "Efficiently Calibrating Agent-based Models of Innovation Diffusion" (in review process). A step-by-step explanation of the algorithm and an implementation can be found in the jupyter notebook `ABM_adoption.ipynb`.
