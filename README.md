#  ABM toy model of innovation diffusion
The presented Agent based model (short: ABM) of innovation diffusion is a very basic ABM that can model the temporal and spatial parts of an Innovation diffusion process. The focus in this repository lies on the main feature, namely the gradients of the model. These gradients enable researchers in the field of Innovation Diffusion to calibrate their models more efficiently. 

The model is part of the publication "Efficiently Calibrating Agent-based Models of Innovation Diffusion" (in review process). A step-by-step explanation of the algorithm and an implementation can be found in the jupyter notebook `code/ABM_adoption.ipynb`.
