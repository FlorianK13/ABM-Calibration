#  ABM toy model of innovation diffusion
The ABM toy model of innovation diffusion is a very basic ABM that can model the temporal and spatial parts of an Innovation diffusion process. As its main feature, gradients of the model can be calculated which makes an efficient calibration possible. The model is part of the publication "Efficiently Calibrating Agent-based Models of Innovation Diffusion". A step by step walkthrough can be found in jupyter notebook ABM_adoption.
